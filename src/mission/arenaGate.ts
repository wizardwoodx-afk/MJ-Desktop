/**
 * MJ 11.14.7 — the Governance Arena Gate (Play C of the differentiator roadmap).
 *
 * 2026 enterprise practice: adversarial batteries gate deployments (Lakera,
 * Promptfoo, PyRIT, Giskard — see docs/DIFFERENTIATOR-ROADMAP.md). MJ's answer
 * is not another LLM red-teaming SaaS — it is a battery that attacks MJ's OWN
 * governance machine with the same hostile intent, and refuses to bless a
 * mission until every scenario is DEFENDED in words.
 *
 * Unlike guardrailAlign (which asserts the SOURCE contains the right markers),
 * this gate EXECUTES the real modules — custody, capability, egress,
 * verifyGate, ledger — with hostile inputs and checks the refusal actually
 * happens. Guardrails-as-code become guardrails-as-executable-battery.
 *
 * Every scenario is deterministic, offline, and requires no harness or LLM:
 * the defences being attacked are mechanical policy boundaries, so the attack
 * either lands (breach → gate REFUSED) or is refused with a reason (defended).
