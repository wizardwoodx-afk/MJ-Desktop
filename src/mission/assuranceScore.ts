/**
 * §FLEET ASSURANCE SCORE — a measured trust metric for agent teams (MJ 14.0).
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS
 * Risk committees and cyber-insurers keep asking the same question about agent fleets:
 * "how much of this team's work is actually EVIDENCED?" Benchmarks answer capability;
 * this answers assurance — how much of what the team did was cross-vendor verified,
 * arena-gated, budget-disciplined, egress-clean and human-rated. Every factor is
 * derived from artifacts MJ already issues (gate verdicts, arena digests, the budget
 * ledger, the egress ledger, human feedback), so the score is an audit input with a
 * breakdown, not a badge.
 *
 * THE HONESTY RULES
 *  - No measured runs → `unevaluated`. The score refuses to exist without evidence —
 *    the same settlement rule the bandit follows. Nothing simulated counts.
 *  - Simulated runs never ADD assurance; they DILUTE it through evidence coverage:
 *    score = rawPoints × measured/(measured+simulated). A team that hides half its
 *    work in labeled simulation gets half-strength assurance.
 *  - The breakdown IS the product: every point names the factor that earned it, and
 *    the score is monotone in each factor (more verification never lowers it).
