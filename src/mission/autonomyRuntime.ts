/**
 * §AUTONOMY RUNTIME — the engines join the real execution path (MJ 11.9.4-Major+).
 *
 * The 11.9.4(Major) review was right: three tested engines that no production
 * call site consumed are validated prototypes, not features. This module is
 * the missing wiring, mirroring how the older evolution loop is folded in
 * (TeamsPage calls evolveTeamAfterRun after every run):
 *
 *   BEFORE a run  — `prepareAutonomy` asks the bandit router which strategy
 *     arms to search this run and hands them to executeTeam via
 *     `req.autonomy` (review depth and check strictness modulate the actual
 *     briefing text agents read; exec:serial really flattens the wave plan;
 *     webEvidence lets the Researcher briefing carry live web evidence).
 *
 *   AFTER a run   — `settleAutonomyAfterRun` records the measured outcome on
 *     exactly the arms the run executed (echoed back in the report), folds a
 *     ScaleSignal from the seat records, and lets the elastic policy act —
 *     AUTONOMOUS teams get the added seat applied to the team, SUGGEST teams
 *     get the decision logged as a suggestion, OFF teams get telemetry only.
 *     Simulated runs remain experience-only (bandit rule), and the whole
 *     settlement lands in the shared autonomyStore so the Evolution page and
 *     the next run read the same state.
