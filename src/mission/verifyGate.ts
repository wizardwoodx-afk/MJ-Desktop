/**
 * §ADVERSARIAL VERIFICATION GATE (MJ 11.9.9) — the heart of the verified agent factory.
 *
 * THE RESEARCH, IN ONE SENTENCE
 * Every 2026 orchestrator — Zapier's agent mode, n8n's LangChain nodes, VectorShift, the
 * whole fleet-orchestrator wave (Orca, Bernstein, Vibe Kanban) — solves COORDINATION.
 * Their own shared, admitted weakness is that nowhere in the stack does anyone solve
 * PROOF: the writer grades itself, and "it ran" is the only evidence on offer.
 *
 * This gate is MJ's answer, enforced rather than encouraged:
 *   - a run is not "verified" unless a seat whose job is verification actually RAN
 *   - verification by the SAME harness that wrote the work is self-grading — in STRICT
 *     mode the run is BLOCKED, in ADVISORY mode it is marked FAIL with the reason attached
 *   - a verdict that rejects the work fails the gate regardless of who signed it
 *   - in STRICT mode the proof receipt must be attached, so the verification itself is
 *     part of the hash-chained evidence an auditor re-verifies
 *
 * Tiers, best first:
 *   cross-vendor     no verifier shares a harness with any writer — the strongest evidence
 *   cross-seat       every writer has a different-harness verifier, but harnesses overlap
 *                    elsewhere in the team (still adversarial where it matters)
 *   self-verification  at least one writer harness has no different-harness verifier
 *   unverified       no verifier seat ran at all
 *
 * Node-import-safe, deterministic, and probed by probe/verifyGate.test.ts.
