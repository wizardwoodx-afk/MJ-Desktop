/**
 * §ELASTIC SEATS — teams that scale to the work, under a cap (MJ 11.9.4-Major).
 *
 * The 2026 orchestration consensus (Deloitte TMT predictions, orchestration
 * guides) is "human-on-the-loop": the platform scales and routes, the human
 * keeps the telemetry and the veto. MJ's teams were fixed at composition
 * time — a run that produced six writer artifacts for zero reviewers still
 * shipped with zero reviewers. Elastic seats lets the runtime propose (and,
 * when the team's evolve mode allows, perform) seat scaling with the same
 * honesty rules the evolution loop obeys:
 *
 *   1. Every decision is a pure function of measured signals — pending tasks,
 *      unreviewed artifacts, failed seats, idle runs. No vibes.
 *   2. Caps are hard: `maxSeats` is never exceeded, `minSeats` never undercut.
 *   3. A seat a human praised (rating ≥4 in the evolution loop) is never
 *      scaled in on — praise suppresses change there too.
 *   4. The planner returns ONE action per call (add-debugger beats
 *      add-reviewer beats scale-in beats hold) so a caller can log the exact
 *      reason; nothing mutates the team behind anyone's back.
