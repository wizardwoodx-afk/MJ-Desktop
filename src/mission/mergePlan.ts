/**
 * MERGE PLANNING — turning N isolated worktrees back into one repository.
 *
 * THE PART EVERYONE GETS WRONG
 *
 * Worktrees solve the collision *during* the work. They do nothing about the moment the work comes
 * back. Merging three agent branches at once means the second merge does not know about the first,
 * which produces conflicts that look like the agents disagreed when really the order was wrong.
 *
 * What this module implements:
 *
 *   1. SERIALIZE. One branch at a time, so each merge sees everything that landed before it.
 *   2. PRE-FLIGHT. `git merge-tree` performs a three-way merge in memory, so conflicts are found
 *      BEFORE anything is merged.
 *   3. DEPENDENCY ORDER. Shared abstractions merge before their consumers, tests last.
 *   4. TEST ON THE BASE AFTER ALL MERGES. Two agents can each pass their own suite and still break the
 *      combination. Integration failures hide exactly there.
 *   5. CLEAN UP. Remove merged worktrees and prune, or they accumulate.
 *
 * THE HONESTY RULE
 *
 * Git detects textual conflicts. It does not detect semantic ones — two agents can each write a
 * correct, non-overlapping change that composes into something broken. So this module never reports
 * "merged cleanly" as "correct". It reports what was merged, in what order, and that the test suite on
 * the base branch is the only thing that settles whether the result works.
