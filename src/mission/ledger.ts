/**
 * MJ 11.12.2 — the Ledger: memory typed by the question it answers.
 *
 * The external review flagged "no typed memory architecture". MJ never stored
 * one blob — lessons, invariants, strategies and skills already live in
 * separate stores — but the taxonomy and, crucially, the WRITE PERMISSIONS
 * were implicit. 11.12.2 names them (Varkha's cognitive decomposition) and
 * makes the write rules mechanical:
 *
 *   STANCE    working memory — this turn's live state; never "retrieved",
 *             just loaded. (session store / turn heartbeats)
 *   PRECEDENT episodic — what happened, in order, with outcomes (success and
 *             environment lessons)
 *   SCAR      failure memory — kept separate and queried FIRST (11.12.1), so
 *             diagnostic failures are never diluted by motivating successes
 *   DOCTRINE  semantic — durable house rules: learned invariants, gate
 *             policy. Agents may PROPOSE; only a human (or the gate) writes.
 *   RECOURSE  procedural — which strategies work: the strategy archive and
 *             approved learned skills. Written only by the measured
 *             experiment (adoption) or human approval.
 *
 * Separation alone is not sufficient — governance over who can write is the
 * other half, so `canWrite` is the rule every writer must pass, pinned by
 * probe/governanceAlign.test.ts.
