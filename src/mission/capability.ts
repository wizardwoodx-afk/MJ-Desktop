 * requests an APPROVED OPERATION; the operation runs where the data lives;
 * only the aggregate answer crosses the boundary — and it crosses through
 * the Egress Gate like everything else, with a signed receipt.
 *
 * Discipline, kept deliberately tight:
 *  - operations come from an explicit whitelist (aggregate-only); there is no
 *    free-form query surface and no path that returns raw rows;
 *  - the request needs a human-signed authority envelope scoped
 *    capability:run — no envelope, wrong scope, expired, revoked or non-human
 *    principal are each refused in words;
 *  - the result is digest-stamped, so the receipt proves WHICH answer left;
 *  - the demo dataset stands in for "company data on this laptop" and is
 *    labelled as such — MJ does not pretend to see a real corporate store.
