/**
 * MJ 11.11.1 SELF-EVOLVING — strategy self-improvement as a genuine online experiment.
 *
 * 11.11.0 kept an archive of strategy versions and scored a candidate on the accumulated
 * run log. The 11.11.0 review caught the flaw precisely: the runs in that log were executed
 * under the PARENT's parameters — the candidate never ran, yet could be credited with the
 * parent's results, and an unmeasured baseline (score null) lost to any real candidate score
 * after a couple of runs. "Strategy self-improvement" was ahead of the implementation.
 *
 * 11.11.1 rebuilds the loop as a causal chain:
 *
 *   candidate proposed → next runs ALTERNATE between baseline and candidate
 *   → each run records WHICH strategy governed it (attribution)
 *   → each arm is scored ONLY on runs executed under its own parameters
 *   → adoption requires MIN_TRIALS measured runs on BOTH arms and a strict margin
 *   → otherwise the candidate waits; at TRIAL_CAP without a verdict it retires inconclusive.
 *
 * A candidate can therefore never be credited with results it did not produce, and a
 * baseline can no longer be unmeasured: the adopted version's score is continuously
 * recomputed from the runs it actually governed. Simulated runs still teach nothing —
 * an arm with only simulated runs has score null and waits.
 *
 * The strategy parameters are not decorative: the runner executes them. serialExec
 * flattens the wave plan (one seat per wave), reviewDepth adds a second independent
 * review pass instruction to every reviewer briefing, checkBias sets how deep the web
 * evidence search is sliced, lessonBudget caps the org-memory lines in ORG_LESSONS.md.
 * The run report records the strategy id + params that governed it, so attribution is
 * a fact in the evidence, not an assumption in the settlement.
