/**
 * AGENT CAPABILITIES — what each coding CLI can actually be made to do, and how MJ knows.
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS AS DATA RATHER THAN CODE
 *
 * Nine CLIs, each with its own vocabulary for the same five ideas: take a prompt, emit JSON, refuse to
 * write, pick a model, resume a conversation. Hardcoding that as branches would scatter nine sets of
 * assumptions across the codebase. As a table, the assumptions are visible, comparable and testable —
 * and, crucially, each one carries the evidence behind it.
 *
 * THE LESSON THIS FILE IS BUILT AROUND
 *
 * A doc-shaped capability table looks identical to a tested one until a real binary disagrees. MJ
 * shipped `--max-turns` for Claude Code because documentation described it; the shipped 2.1.197
 * binary has no such flag. It shipped `--dangerously-skip-permissions` for OpenCode, which does not
 * exist there at all. Both were found only by running the executable.
 *
 * So every entry states its confidence and its source, and `enforcedReadOnly()` is keyed off
 * enforcement rather than off whether a flag merely exists.
 */
